# About Me

I am a Research Associate in the [BIG](http://www.biglab.co.uk) lab, computer science department at the [University of Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/). I'm working in the field of Multi-sensory technology and shape change devices for inclusive education. 

I was awarded the PhD in Nov 2019. Before that, I was a PhD candidate in the research group in Cognitive Science and Centre for Digital Music in the school of Electronic Enginnering and Computer Science ([EECS](http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk)), Queen Mary University of London ([QMUL](https://www.qmul.ac.uk)).

My research stand across the fields of Human-computer interaction (**HCI**), Human-robot interaction (**HRI**). In particular, my projects built on the theoretical account of embodied cognition and multi-sensory percecption, endevour to understand and utilise affordance for a better interaction between human and computers/robots.
