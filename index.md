# About Me

I am a Postdoc researcher at the [HCI research group](https://hci.au.dk/) at the [Aarhus University](https://international.au.dk/), and a visiting researcher at the [BIG](http://www.biglab.co.uk) lab, computer science department at the [University of Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/). My current project is about understanding emotion regulation, developing design theories, and building Multi-sensory interfaces for affective interaction. 

I was awarded my PhD at the [Cognitive Science](http://cogsci.eecs.qmul.ac.uk) research group, School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science ([EECS](http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk)), Queen Mary University of London ([QMUL](https://www.qmul.ac.uk)).

My research projects stand across the fields of Human-computer interaction (**HCI**), Cognitive psychology and Design. My projects build on the theoretical account of embodied cognition and multi-sensory perception. They involve the development of multi-sensory technology through human-centred approach, understanding interaction experience through lab studies and in the wild, and construct design theories and toolkits for affective interaction.
