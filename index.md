# About Me

I am a Research Associate in the [BIG](http://www.biglab.co.uk) lab, computer science department at the [University of Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/). My current project is about understanding Multi-sensory technologies for inclusive education and health care. 

I was awarded my PhD in Nov 2019 at the [Cognitive Science] research group(http://cogsci.eecs.qmul.ac.uk), School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science ([EECS](http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk)), Queen Mary University of London ([QMUL](https://www.qmul.ac.uk)).

My research projects stand across the fields of Human-computer interaction (**HCI**) and Human-robot interaction (**HRI**). My projects build on the theoretical account of embodied cognition and multi-sensory perception. They involve the development of multi-sensory technology through human-centred approach, understanding interaction experience through lab studies and in the wild, and evaluation of interaction at personal, inter-personal and crowd levels. 
<!-- of endevour to understand and utilise affordance for a better interaction between human and computers/robots. -->
