## Design
Before my PhD, I studied Industrial design in the school of Mechenical Engineering ([ME](http://www.mech.sdu.edu.cn/ENGLISH.htm)), Shandong University ([SDU](http://www.sdu.edu.cn), Double-First Class University, Rank Aï¼‰in China, with 1st class honours; and Interaction Design in the design school at Human University ([HNU](http://design.hnu.edu.cn/Home.htm)), one of the top 3 design schools in China. 

As a designer, I designed the visual identification system (VI system) for the [China Acedemy Museum](http://ylsy.hnu.edu.cn/content.jsp?urltype=news.NewsContentUrl&wbtreeid=1081&wbnewsid=1275).

In previous intership/design projects, I've worked with [Oulin](http://www.oulin.net/product2.html) and conducted ethnographic study for the design of IoT smart kitchen in 2013. 

I've participated in the creation of a campus journal "The voice of Yuelu" (Yuelu is a metaphor of academics) with [Business school](http://ibschool-en.hnu.edu.cn) in Hunan University. With the collabroatoin from MBA collegues, we together designed and edited the first five issues with focus on business models covering product desgin, interaction design and the general service industry (2013-2014). Unfortunately, I graduated in 2014 and stop working on it. and the journal discontinued in 2015.
