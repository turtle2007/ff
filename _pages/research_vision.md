## My Research Trajectories

My research has two complementary strands: skilled sensorimotor action and first-person experience. Both address issues of multisensory perception and interaction in applied Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research. In both, I translate theories from cognitive science, adapting them to the needs of multisensory interface design. My current work brings these strands together to focus on support for affective regulation.

The first strand of my work, on skilled sensorimotor action, draws on psychology of multisensory perception to support skill learning, and guide movement. During my PhD research, I designed multisensory interfaces to support rehabilitation, wayfinding, and sensory-motor skills, drawing on scientific understandings of how information is perceived and guides action. More recently, I adapted methodologies from psychophysics to understand tactile skill in surgical training. Increasingly, I have become interested in the complex contextual factors around such skill learning and practice (for example, in surgical environments)and how these impact experience, outcomes, and research methods.

The second strand of my work, on first-person experience, has often focused on understanding how affective experience during interaction relates to perceptual factors, and how this can be mapped to parameters for design and engineering. Much of my work here has been grounded in theories of crossmodal perception from sensory psychology - accounts of the synergies between different sensory modalities and affective experiences. I have drawn on my background in industrial design, to investigate how these scientific theories can support the design of tangible and wearable interfaces. For CHI 2025, I have co-developed a workshop proposal to address design theories grounded in multi- and cross-sensory interaction. 

### The works that I am particularly proud of

I am particularly proud of my recent works on thermal interaction, which connects perceptual science to aesthetic and humanistic accounts of experience. Over the years, generations of HCI researchers have returned to the question of how we should connect controlled scientific findings to the complexities of real-world interactions. In my recent work, I address this via a scientifically informed analysis of literary accounts of thermal-affective experience, following similar approaches in sensory psychology. These literary accounts provide eloquent and evocative descriptions of situated experience, situated in everyday life and activities - something otherwise difficult to capture. Analysing them allows me to suggest principles and guidelines for the design of thermalaffective experiences, and specify future empirical research in the field ([The design framework paper]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/dis24-202.pdf)). This work has opened a rich seam of research ideas for me which I am now addressing. This includes design research to understand the possibilities of thermal-haptic interfaces for affective regulation, and the development of a toolkit for prototyping which bridges experiential and engineering aspects of thermal-haptic experience ([Thermal cards]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/TEI2025-Pic.pdf)).

### My research vision

In the future, I would like to be known as a researcher who is leading the translational science in the field of affective interaction in HCI: my work creates bridges between experiential, scientific, and design approaches to support the development of multisensory technologies. My research toolkits will help engineering-focused researchers address the complexity of affective and situated experience, and help design-focused researchers connect their understandings to scientific and engineering principles. In particular, I plan to pursue this goal in the context of multisensory technologies for affective interaction and affective regulation in children and both neurodiverse and neurotypical populations.


## Something More About My Previous Design
Before my PhD, I studied Industrial design in the school of Mechenical Engineering ([ME](http://www.mech.sdu.edu.cn/ENGLISH.htm)), Shandong University ([SDU](http://www.sdu.edu.cn), Double-First Class University, Rank Aï¼‰in China, with 1st class honours; and Interaction Design in the design school at Human University ([HNU](http://design.hnu.edu.cn/Home.htm)), one of the top 3 design schools in China. 

As a designer, I designed the branding and visual identity system (VI system) for the [China Academy Museum](http://ylsy.hnu.edu.cn/wbly/wbsy.htm).

In previous intership/design projects, I've worked with [Oulin](http://www.oulin.net/product2.html) and conducted ethnographic study for the design of IoT smart kitchen project. 

I've participated in the creation of a campus journal "The voice of Yuelu" (Yuelu is a metaphor of academics) with the [Business school](http://ibschool-en.hnu.edu.cn) in Hunan University. With the collaboration of MBA collegues, we together designed and edited the first five issues with focus on business models covering product desgin, interaction design and the general service industry (2013-2014). 
<!-- Unfortunately, I graduated in 2014 and stop working on it. and the journal discontinued in 2015. -->
