## Augmented crossmodal feedback for sensory-motor synchronisation

### What is sensory-motor synchronisation and why it's worth notice?
- Sensory-motor synchronisation is ...
- This abililty is an unique feature of human being. It is important for ...

## The modulation effect of implicit memory and crossmodal correspondences (CCs) for sketches



### What is implicit memory?
- Memory architecture
<!-- <figure>

</figure> -->

### What is crossmodal correspondences (CCs)?
- In everyday situation, people consciously and/or subconsciously perceive informaiton from more than five or six senses, vision, audition, haptics, olfaction, gustation, proprioception, locomotion... How does the brain knows which informaiton perceive through different modality that happened at one time should be combined? How does it produce the most robust and veridical perception?

- Some of the informaiton features encountered in everyday life are perceptually associated, such as a high pitch sound always associated with smaller object and higher position. In this case, we say that the auditory perception of pitch is ``corresponded``  with visual perception of size and elevation.

- Crossmodal ``correspondences`` (CCs) is a way that brain organising and combining information from various sources. 

- This perceptual feature is shared by a large number of people across languages and cultures and over the course of human development (though some evidence showed that people who has autism
spectrum disorder do not possess such perceptual feature). This universal feature thus has great utilisational value for the design of ubiquitous human-machine, human-computer, huamn-robot interfaces.

### What do I mean by 'modulation effect'?
- It means the influence of crossmodal information on sketch input behaviours in terms of ``speed`` and ``accuracy``.
- Specifically, we were looking at the ``speed`` of task fulfilment and sketch motion, as well as the ``accuracy`` of sketches and the spatial accuracy of sketch motion.

### What people do with the CCs during sketch?
- ``Step 1`` The task first requires people to watch a video that contains CCs. The purpose is to 

- ``Step 2`` Then they will do the task. They first see crossmodal stimuli flash in a certain sequence that follows a certain trajectory as show in the following figure. 

<figure>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/proj2/9patterns.png" width = "300"/>
</figure>

The modality features involved in this experiment are: visual brightness, auditory pitch and vibrotactile intensity.

The crossmodal stimuli conforms the CCs, as shown in this table:

| Modalities   |      Correspondences     |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| Visual-auditory CC|  high brightness - high pitch & low brightness - low pitch |
| Visual-haptic CC |    high brightness - high intensity & low brightness - low intensity   |
| Auditory-haptic CC | high pitch - high intensity & low pitch - low intensity |
{: .table .table-striped .table-hover}

- ``Step 3`` Then people reproduce the sequence by sketching acorss the stimuli. For example:

<figure>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/proj2/example_spatial.png" width = "400"/>
</figure>

- If you want to replicate the experiment, read my paper and following the steps in the 'do it yourself' session.

### Interesting discoveries
- **Effect of the memory:** We discovered that implicit memory can influence interaction performance. Specifically, priming the implicit memory about CCs (people who watched the priming video in ``Step 1``) can improve high-level task accuracy with reduced task complition time.

- **Effect of the feedback:** We also discovered that people have higher motor accuracy along the horizontal axis with vibrotactile feedback (``Visual-haptic``), and along the vertical axis with auditory feedback (``Visual-auditory``).

### Application area
- Activate implicit memory about perceptual regularities in cognitive-demanding scenario, such as operation in control room, or device monitoring in clinical scinario, can improve task accuracy, possiblly because of the expanded working memory capacity due to priming.

- Augmenting motion phsses with vibrotactile and auditory feedback (terminal feedback in this particular case) can be apply to the area of motor skill training.
