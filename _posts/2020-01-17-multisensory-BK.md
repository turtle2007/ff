## The "BK" and the multisensory experience
BK is abbreviation of "Bouba-kiki", which represents two types of shapes: shape "Bouba" and shape "Kiki". They are originally look like this:

<figure>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bk/bk.jpg" width = "400"/>
</figure>

<h4>Make a guess about which label belongs to which shape </h4> (Don't google before making a guess!). I have greater than 95% chance of guessing your answer correct. If I'm wrong, unfortunately or fortunately, you are one of the less than 5% outliers in the whole population!

## Tangible BK 
The above example shows crossmodal correlation exists between 2D-shape recognition and phonemes.

This perceptual correlation has also been found between 3D-shapes and the phonemes of "Bouba" and "Kiki" alike, as shown in the figure below.

<figure>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bk/bkTangible.jpeg" width = "400"/>
</figure>

## How this can be utilised in design?
<!-- In a CHI mentality, the next question we are thinking about is  -->
How can we leverage such a perceptual regularity to benefit our life?

An interesting application is to build a perceptual common ground, for instance, the [tangible pain assessment tool](https://designawards.core77.com/health-wellness/82835/Tangible-Pain-Assessment-Tools). This project uses tangible "Bouba-kiki" shapes to present "a range of expressive possibilities, allowing young children to communicate qualitative information that they typically are unable to communicate due to limitations in their linguistic capacity."

</figure>
(This figure is adopted from the core77.)


### Shape-change BK robot
<!-- Our ``research concerns`` how people understand the affordances that shape-change device, interfaces and robots provide, both physically and psychologically.

At the current stage, we ``aim`` to empirically investigate emotional states that people can perceive based on the transition between tangible "Bouba" and "Kiki".

We built a pneumatically actuated robot, the BK robot, and control the size, speed, and frequency of the change between the "Bouba" and "Kiki". -->

<!-- **Result:** wait for the update. -->

## BK for fun: augment heart beat
This little bot feels your heart and synchronises its beat with you.

## Next step: 

* Understanding the effect of shape-transformation on emotional states, so that:

* a. Develop a wearable shape-change skin for robot and human

* b. Explore how this shape-change mechanism can be applied to Human-human and Human-robot interaction (HHI and HRI)
 


<!-- ## Installation and Quick Usage
* Fork the [Halve repo](https://github.com/TaylanTatli/Halve/fork)
* Edit `_config.yml` file.

If you want to make a **Project Page**, you have to use `gh-pages` branch. For **Personal Page**; `master` branch. More info [here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll/#jekylls-build-process).

#### description


Examples:

{% highlight yaml %}
url: http://taylantatli.me/Halve
url: http://localhost:4000
url: //cooldude.github.io
url:
{% endhighlight %}

#### background
Here we will set images for left block. Example:

```
background:
  homepage: images/home.png
  post-list: images/unsplash-image-10.jpg
  default-post: images/unsplash-gallery-image-3.jpg 
```

<dl>
  <dt>homepage</dt>
  <dd>Is for homepage background image.</dd>
  <dt>post-list</dt>
  <dd>Is for posts list page background image.</dd>
  <dt>default-post</dt>
  <dd>Is for posts' default background image. It will be shown for every posts that don't specify any image from post's YAML front matter.</dd>
</dl>

### Projects Overlay

To set what image links appear in the overlay menu edit `_data/projects.yaml`. Use the following format to set the URL, title, image and project status for as many links as you'd like. If you set `completed` to `false` like `completed: false`, it won't be clickable until you set it true like `completed: true`

{% highlight yaml %}
- title: Moon Jekyll Theme
  url: http://taylantatli.me/Moon
  image: https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/754514/14509720/61c61058-01d6-11e6-93ab-0918515ecd56.png
  completed: true
{% endhighlight %}

---

### Images for Posts

You can set left block image per post. Just add `image: some link` to your post's front matter. If you don't set this, default post image will be used from `_config.yml`.

```
image: /assets/img/some-image.png
or
image: http://example.com/some-image.png
```    
 This also will be used for twitter card:
