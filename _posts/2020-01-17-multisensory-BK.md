<center><b>Halve</b> is a stylish, two-column jekyll theme.</center><br>
     
 This theme is Jekyll port of [vangeltzo.com](http://vangeltzo.com/) (by [Vangelis Tzortzis](https://github.com/srekoble)). I couldn't stop myself to port this theme when I saw his site. And he kindly gave me permission to share this with you. -->

## The "BK" and the multisensory experience
BK is abbreviation of "Bouba-kiki", which represents two types of shapes: shape "Bouba" and shape "Kiki". They are originally look like this:

<figure>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bk/bk.jpg" width = "400"/>
</figure>

Make a guess about which label belongs to which shape (Don't google before making a guess!). I have greater than 95% chance of getting your answer correct. If I'm wrong, unfortunately or fortunately, you are one of the less than 5% outliers in the whole population!

## Tangible BK 
Above example shows crossmodal correlation exists between 2D-shape recognition and phonemes.

This perceptual correlation also been found between 3D-shapes and the phonemes of "Bouba" and "Kiki" alike, as shown in the figure below.

<figure>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bk/bkTangible.jpeg" width = "400"/>
</figure>

## How this can be utilised in design?
In a CHI mentality, the next question we are thinking about is how can we leverage such a perceptual regularity to benefit our life?

An interting application is to build a perceptual common ground, for instance, the [tangible pain assessment tool](https://designawards.core77.com/health-wellness/82835/Tangible-Pain-Assessment-Tools).

<figure>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bk/bkexample.jpeg" width = "400"/>
</figure>
(This figure is adopted from the core77 website.)

This project use tangible "Bouba-kiki" shapes to present "a range of expressive possibilities, allowing young children to communicate qualitative information that they typically are unable to communicate due to limitations in their linguistic capacity."

### Shape-change BK robot
Our ``research concerns`` how people interact with the affordance that shape-change deviced, interfaces and robots provides, both physically and psychologically.

At the current stage, we ``aim`` to empirically investigate emotional states that peole can perceive based on the transition between tangible "Bouba" and "Kiki".

We built a pneumatically actuated robot, the BK robot, and control the size, speed, and frequency of the change between the "Bouba" and "Kiki".

{% highlight yaml %}
url: http://taylantatli.me/Halve
url: http://localhost:4000
url: //cooldude.github.io
url:
{% endhighlight %}

#### background
Here we will set images for left block. Example:

```
background:
  homepage: images/home.png
  post-list: images/unsplash-image-10.jpg
  default-post: images/unsplash-gallery-image-3.jpg 
```

<dl>
  <dt>homepage</dt>
  <dd>Is for homepage background image.</dd>
  <dt>post-list</dt>
  <dd>Is for posts list page background image.</dd>
  <dt>default-post</dt>
  <dd>Is for posts' default background image. It will be shown for every posts that don't specify any image from post's YAML front matter.</dd>
</dl>

### Projects Overlay

To set what image links appear in the overlay menu edit `_data/projects.yaml`. Use the following format to set the URL, title, image and project status for as many links as you'd like. If you set `completed` to `false` like `completed: false`, it won't be clickable until you set it true like `completed: true`

{% highlight yaml %}
- title: Moon Jekyll Theme
  url: http://taylantatli.me/Moon
  image: https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/754514/14509720/61c61058-01d6-11e6-93ab-0918515ecd56.png
  completed: true
{% endhighlight %}

### Images for Posts

You can set left block image per post. Just add `image: some link` to your post's front matter. If you don't set this, default post image will be used from `_config.yml`.

```
image: /assets/img/some-image.png
or
image: http://example.com/some-image.png
```    
 This also will be used for twitter card:
